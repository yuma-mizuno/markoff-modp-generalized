# Rational Rankin bounds for truncated exact-order sums

This isolates the analytic inequality from any particular factorization
certificate.  Rational weights make every later finite certificate exactly
checkable.

/-- Abstract rational-weight Rankin bound.

For every divisor order in the truncated range, the hypotheses say that
`weight(order)` is at least its inverse twelfth root, while `cap` is at
least the twelfth root of `bound`.  The conclusion bounds the exact
truncated root count by a weighted sum over all divisors of `N`. -/
