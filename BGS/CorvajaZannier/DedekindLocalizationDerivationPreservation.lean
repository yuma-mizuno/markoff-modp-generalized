# Derivations preserving localizations

An ambient derivation that maps a domain into itself also maps every prime
localization into itself.  The statement deliberately does not require an
algebra structure from the derivation's constant ring to the localized ring;
that structure need not exist in the Frobenius-constant application.

/-- An ambient derivation which preserves a domain also preserves each of its
localizations at a prime.  This is the quotient-rule bridge from a global
different-annihilator certificate to the local DVR Wronskian bounds. -/
