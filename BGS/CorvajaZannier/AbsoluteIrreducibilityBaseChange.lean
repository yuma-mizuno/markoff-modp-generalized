# Base change of absolutely irreducible multivariate polynomials

An irreducible multivariate polynomial over an algebraic closure remains
irreducible after extending its original coefficient field to an arbitrary
field.  The proof is a direct Nullstellensatz descent.  Given a hypothetical
factorization over the target field, introduce one variable for each of its
finitely many coefficients and two additional variables for inverses of
chosen nonconstant coefficients.  A closed point of a maximal ideal over the
kernel specializes the factorization to the algebraically closed field, while
the inverse relations ensure that both specialized factors remain nonunits.

The final theorem supplies the exact constant-field base-change step used in
Corvaja--Zannier's auxiliary-family argument.
