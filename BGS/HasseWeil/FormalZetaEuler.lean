# Euler recurrences for a formal effective-divisor zeta series

This file packages the exact formal boundary between the remaining
closed-place combinatorics and zeta rationality.  A coefficient sequence `A`
satisfies Euler's recurrence when marking one degree unit in an effective
divisor gives the convolution with extension point counts.  That recurrence
is precisely the coefficient form of `Z' = Z * pointCountDerivativeSeries`.

Together with the proved uniqueness and eventual-recurrence results, this
turns the two explicit coefficient identities into either the indexed or the
standard polynomial zeta numerator.
