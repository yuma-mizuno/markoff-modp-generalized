# Uniqueness of a normalized formal point-count zeta series

Over the complex numbers, the differential equation

`Z' = Z * A`

together with the constant coefficient of `Z` determines a formal power
series uniquely.  This gives the formal bridge needed after proving Euler's
coefficient identity for an effective-divisor zeta series: that series is the
canonical exponential `formalPointCountZeta`.
