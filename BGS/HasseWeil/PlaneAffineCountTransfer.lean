# Numerical transfer from normalization counts to affine counts

The geometric comparison between an affine plane curve and its normalization
is naturally expressed by two inequalities between natural-number
cardinalities.  This file isolates the real absolute-value bookkeeping needed
to combine those inequalities with the closed Hasse--Weil bound.

/-- If the affine and normalization counts differ by at most `error` in both
directions, then a Hasse--Weil bound for the normalization transfers to the
affine count, with the affine/projective constant `1` and `error` added. -/
