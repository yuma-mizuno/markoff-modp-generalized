# Formal zeta identity under a constant extension

Let `N r` be the point count over the degree-`r` extension of the original
constant field.  If all nonzero counts occur in degrees divisible by `d`,
and the point counts after the degree-`d` constant extension satisfy

`N_extended r = N (d * r)`,

then the exponential point-count zeta series satisfy

`Z_extended(T^d) = Z(T)^d`.

The proof does not assume this identity.  It reindexes the logarithmic
derivative series and then applies the already proved uniqueness theorem for
normalized formal differential equations.
