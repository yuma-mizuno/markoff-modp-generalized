# Weighted degree cancellation over finite-support fibers

This file upgrades the unweighted finite-family constant-extension identity to
finitely supported multiplicities.  The ambient types need not be finite: a
nonzero downstairs coefficient forces every point in its fiber into the
finite upstairs support, so the relevant fiber can be counted there.

/-- Weighted form of the constant-extension degree cancellation.  Suppose
upstairs multiplicities are pulled back from downstairs, upstairs degrees are
obtained by division by `gcd(r, degree)`, and the full fiber has that gcd as
its cardinality.  Then the two finitely supported weighted degree sums agree.

No finiteness assumption is imposed on `Base` or `Up`; only the supports of
the two `Finsupp`s are used as finite indexing sets. -/
