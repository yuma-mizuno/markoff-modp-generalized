# Finite-order Markoff rotations have torsion eigenvalues

This file isolates the algebraic kernel used in the opening argument of
Bourgain--Gamburd--Sarnak.  Over an algebraically closed field, a finite-order
normalized rotation has an eigenvalue of finite multiplicative order, and its
trace is the sum of that eigenvalue and its inverse.

The passage from a finite orbit of a *point* to finite order of the rotation
matrix is deliberately not assumed here.  It is a separate geometric step,
and is delicate at the parabolic traces `2` and `-2`.

/-- A finite-order normalized rotation has a torsion eigenvalue whose
eigenvalue trace is the rotation parameter.

This includes the parabolic eigenvalues.  In that case the eigenvalue squares
to one, so it is visibly torsion; away from that case the existing
diagonalization theorem transfers finite order from the rotation to the
eigenvalue. -/

/-- Periodicity of one vector under a coordinate rotation does not by itself
imply finite order of the rotation matrix.  The nonzero vector `(1,1)` is
fixed by the trace-`2` rotation, while that matrix has infinite order in
characteristic zero.

This is the parabolic obstruction that must be handled before the paper's
finite-orbit discussion can invoke `finiteOrderRotation_has_torsion_eigenvalue`.
