# The weighted trace curve is not a subtorus translate

This module proves the non-specialness condition needed by the
Corvaja--Zannier torsion-point bound.  The proof uses the two deck involutions
of the weighted trace curve and keeps all degenerate parameters explicit.

/-- If both weights are nonzero, the complete weighted trace curve is not a
character fiber in the two-dimensional torus.  No characteristic restriction
is needed.

This deliberately does not assume `alpha * beta ≠ 1`.  When the product is
one the curve is reducible into two subtorus translates, but no single
character is constant on their union.  Thus this proposition is the correct
non-specialness condition only when paired with the separate absolute
irreducibility hypothesis, exactly as it is in
`WeightedTraceCurveIsCorvajaZannierAdmissible`. -/
