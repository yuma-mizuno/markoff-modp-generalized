# The characteristic restriction in the split trace-cover lemma

The published absolute-irreducibility statement for the split trace cover does not require the
covering exponents to be prime to the characteristic.  This omission is substantive: when both
exponents equal the positive characteristic, the cleared trace polynomial is a Frobenius power.

This file records the obstruction directly on the polynomial used by the endgame.  It is kept
separate from the positive Kummer descent: the theorem below is a counterexample to an omitted
hypothesis, not another assumption on which downstream formalization may rely.
