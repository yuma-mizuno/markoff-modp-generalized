# The exact projective-to-torus point-count bridge

Mathlib currently has no general smooth-projective curve, genus, normalization,
and Hasse--Weil package from which the endgame estimate can be derived.  This
module therefore starts at the first honest arithmetic interface:

* an explicit equivalence between affine cover zeros and projective rational
  points away from an explicit boundary finset;
* the Hasse inequality for that projective model, passed as a proposition;
* independent numerical genus and boundary bounds.

The conclusion is the desired `O(sqrt (#K) * d * e)` estimate for the actual
Laurent trace-solution finset.  No target estimate is hidden in a typeclass.

/-- An explicit projective comparison, Hasse inequality, genus bound, and
boundary bound imply the split trace-cover estimate on the original torus.

`projectivePoints` is intended to be the rational-point finset of the smooth
projective normalization, and `projectiveBoundary` its complement of the
affine chart.  Requiring an actual equivalence of finite types prevents the
model comparison from being replaced by a cardinality assertion about the
desired torus count. -/
