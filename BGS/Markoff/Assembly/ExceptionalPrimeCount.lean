# Exceptional-prime consequences of Chen orbit divisibility

Chen's component-divisibility theorem, formalized here through Martin's later elementary proof,
upgrades the giant-orbit half of Theorem 1 to strong approximation at every sufficiently large
prime.  This file records the resulting finite exceptional-prime set and derives the subpower
exceptional-prime bound of Theorem 2.
