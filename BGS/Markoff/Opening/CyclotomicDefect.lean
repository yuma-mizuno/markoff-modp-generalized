# The cyclotomic defect in the opening

This module isolates the characteristic-zero algebra used after compatible finite-field
eigenvalues have been lifted to roots of unity.  The difficult number-field reduction interface
is not assumed here: given three complex unit-circle lifts, we define the symmetric defect,
prove its uniform archimedean bound, and prove that it cannot vanish unless all three traces do.
