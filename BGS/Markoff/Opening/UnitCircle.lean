# The real compactness lemma in the opening

The published opening rules out finite characteristic-zero orbits by first placing all three
normalized trace coordinates in `[-2, 2]`.  The elementary real inequality used at that point is
proved here independently of the later cyclotomic lifting argument.

/-- A real normalized Markoff point whose first trace coordinate lies in `[-2, 2]` is the
origin.  In particular, the published hypothesis that all three coordinates lie in this interval
is more than is needed.

The proof uses `2|bc| ≤ b² + c²`.  Since the Markoff equation makes `abc` equal to the
nonnegative sum of three squares and `|a| ≤ 2`, it follows that `a² ≤ 0`; the remaining two
squares then vanish as well. -/
