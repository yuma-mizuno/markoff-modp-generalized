# Torsion eigenvalue traces force the complex Markoff origin

This is the characteristic-zero contradiction at the heart of the opening.  Once each
coordinate of a complex normalized Markoff point is represented by a torsion eigenvalue and its
reciprocal, the unit-circle defect argument forces all three coordinates to vanish.
