# Basic divisor API aliases

This file re-exports the coordinate divisor API from `FunctionField.Divisor` under the names
used in downstream modules (`degA`, `placeDegA`), and hosts the standing
`IsFullConstantField` hypothesis.

to `k` being relatively algebraically closed in `K`, i.e. Mathlib's `algebraicClosure k K = ⊥`;

/-- `IsFullConstantField k K` is exactly the statement that `k` is relatively algebraically
closed in `K`, i.e. it coincides with Mathlib's `algebraicClosure k K = ⊥`. This identifies the
standing hypothesis with the standard field-theoretic notion. -/
